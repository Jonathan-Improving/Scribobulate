# Is the librsvg this bundle delivers at or above the security floor?
#
# CVE-2026-96889 / RUSTSEC-2026-0305 (librsvg #1241): a use-after-free when a nested
# XInclude redefines an XML entity, fixed in librsvg 2.63.2. Every SVG a document references
# reaches librsvg through the gdk-pixbuf SVG loader, and that loader follows a `data:`
# XInclude with no base URL. MEASURED on 2.62.3: a `data:` include drew into the pixbuf. The
# application's own XInclude screen is compiled out on macOS because this bundle carries the
# fix, so THIS GATE IS THE ONLY THING standing between a stale Homebrew keg and a delivered
# use-after-free.
#
# THE VERSION IS READ FROM THE STAGED DYLIB, by loading it and reading its exported
# `rsvg_{major,minor,micro}_version`. Not from `pkg-config` and not from `brew list`: both
# describe Homebrew, and the artefact is what is delivered. `brew upgrade` leaves the old keg in
# the Cellar beside the new one, so "Homebrew has 2.63.2" and "the bundle has 2.63.2" are two
# different claims.
#
# RUN IT ONLY ON A SIGNED BUNDLE. The staged copies have had install_name_tool run over
# them, which invalidates their signatures, and on Apple Silicon the kernel SIGKILLs a
# process that loads one (see the loader-cache step in bundle.sh). bundle.sh therefore calls
# this AFTER codesign. A reader killed that way exits non-zero and this gate fails closed.
#
# FAILS CLOSED in every other way too: no librsvg in the bundle, no python3, a dylib that
# will not load, or missing version symbols are all failures, never a skipped check. A
# bundle without librsvg also has no working SVG loader, so there is nothing to pass.
#
