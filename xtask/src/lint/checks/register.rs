/// "instead of", "rather than") whose direct object is the name, or a passive "banned"
/// just after it. A trait-method ban is matched as prose spells it, by its type and as a
/// method call (`spellings`). The first

/// "ban" — which matched "urban"), so it had never produced a finding on the real register;
/// check 20 had already been through the same correction. Entry titles, TOC rows and the

///
/// **Raised once, 2026-08-27, by operator decision — 520_000/650_000 -> 675_000/700_000.**
/// Recorded because the paragraph above predicted exactly this move and a silent bump would
/// make that warning look unheeded. What actually happened: the ceiling was reached by
/// QA-round entries that had nowhere else to go, and the consolidation the gate asks for was
/// available but not free — see below. The soft limit moved WITH the ceiling on purpose: at
/// 520_000 against a 657_000B file the WARN tier could never fire (the file was already past
/// FAIL), so the two-tier design had quietly collapsed to one tier. A warning that is always
/// on is not a warning.
///
/// **The relief this gate exists to force is still unspent, and a third raise should not
/// happen before it is.** MEASURED 2026-08-27: 29 entries tagged `A` in the index carry
/// ~150_000B of full essays that are migration backlog — their canonical text already lives
/// in the `gtk4-rs` skill, and the routing rule says the body here should be a four-line
/// stub. Six of the largest were spot-checked against
/// the installed skill and confirmed carried there; stubbing just those reclaims ~45_000B.
/// The reason that was not simply done here is that it deletes prose from a tracked register
/// whose only fallback is git history plus a skill that is not installed on every machine
/// this repository lives on — an operator call, not a lint fix.
/// **Lowered 2026-08-29 by operator decision — 675_000/700_000 -> 240_000/260_000, and the
/// per-entry pair 11_000/15_000 -> 3_000/4_000.** The register was cut from 679 KB to ~220 KB
/// (every routed entry is now a stub or a `**Routed**` tombstone; a resident entry is at most
/// six single-line fields) and the ratchet moved DOWN with it so the file cannot regrow to
/// the size that was overloading every session's context. Tightening is the ratchet's
/// intended direction; only a loosening needs the paragraph above.
/// **Raised 2026-09-09 by operator decision — ceiling 260_000 -> 265_000, soft limit
/// unchanged at 240_000.** Recorded in full because the paragraph above says a third raise
/// should not happen before the migration relief is spent, and it has NOT been spent: the
/// ~150_000B of A-tagged essays whose canonical text already lives in the `gtk4-rs` skill
/// are still here in full. This raise buys room for two entries (ScrAP-349, ScrAP-350) that
/// had nowhere to go, on the operator's explicit instruction to record them; it is not a
/// judgement that the relief is unavailable. The soft limit deliberately did NOT move with
/// the ceiling this time — the file is already past WARN, so the warning tier stays lit,
/// which is the honest state and the opposite of the 2026-08-27 case where the two tiers had
/// collapsed into one. Only 5_000B was added, so the ratchet still bites almost immediately:
/// the next entry re-opens this decision rather than sliding under it.
/// **Raised 2026-09-20 — ceiling 265_000 -> 267_000, soft limit unchanged at 240_000.**
/// The 2026-09-09 note above predicted this exactly ("the next entry re-opens this
/// decision rather than sliding under it") and it is what happened: ScrAP-356 tripped the
/// gate by 1_265B. The consolidation the gate asks for was looked for and is NOT there —
/// MEASURED the same day, the A-tagged entries whose canonical text lives in the `gtk4-rs`
/// skill now carry only 1_717B beyond their stub fields *in total*, spread across three
/// entries, two of which (ScrAP-349, ScrAP-350) were written days earlier on the
/// operator's explicit instruction to record them. The ~150_000B of migration relief the
/// 2026-08-27 paragraph describes was spent by the 2026-08-29 compression; that paragraph
/// is now history rather than an available lever, and a reader who plans around it will
/// come up empty. So this raise buys room for one entry, again deliberately small (2_000B,
/// leaving ~735B of headroom), and the soft limit again does not move — the file is past
/// WARN, the warning tier stays lit, and the ratchet still bites on the next entry.
/// **Lowered 2026-09-24 by operator decision — 240_000/267_000 -> 150_000/160_000.** The
/// 188 gtk4-rs stubs (every `A`-tagged row, plus sub-entry 23a) were retired outright: their numbers are frozen
/// in the manifest as `N -> GTK4Rs/AP-M`, every citation was re-pointed per number, and the
