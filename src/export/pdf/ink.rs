//! Ink: turning measured fragments into marks on a cairo surface.
//!
//! The counterpart to [`super::measure`]-style work — this module owns the *drawing*
//! half of the sink and nothing else. It decides nothing: what page a line lands on came
//! from [`super::super::paginate`], how wide a column is came from
//! [`super::geometry`], and what a construct is came from [`super::decide`]. What is
//! left is cairo.
//!
//! **That claim was FALSE for a while and this note is what makes it checkable.** Five
//! decisions had leaked in: theme-key-else-palette for the quote bar and the rule, and
//! sprite-vs-flat precedence for the bar, the band and the rule — each of them a
//! definite answer no measurement can change, and each unreachable from a test without a
//! cairo surface and a page (F-INKSEAM-001). They are `decide::wash_of` and
//! `decide::band_wash` now, both generic over the sprite payload so the PRECEDENCE can
//! be exercised with a stand-in and no image at all. What is left here is
//! [`paint_wash`]: given a settled `Wash`, fill a rectangle.
//!
//! # Every glyph goes through `show_layout_line`
//!
//! **Never** a per-run `show_glyph_string` loop. That hands cairo positioned glyphs with
//! no UTF-8 and no cluster information, which silently destroys the PDF's text layer:
//! the page still looks correct and nothing in it can be searched, selected or copied
//! (TDD 25.18). It is the kind of regression that passes every visual check.

            // WHITE half and closes with the next plate's black; the rect-anchored one
