//! Part C — the preview-side **create** overlay. When the reader
//! selects text in the preview, a small non-autohide **GtkPopover** offers **Annotate**;
//! clicking it dismisses the popover and reveals an in-surface comment-entry card (an
//! GtkOverlay child) at the same anchor, whose Save wraps the selected source range in
//! CriticMarkup (or, for a cross-block selection, drops a point comment at the selection
//! end) via the view's annotation sink.
//!
//! The selection→source mapping ([`create_from_selection`]) and the entry-card placement
//! geometry ([`bar_placement`], and the shared `saferizer::ViewportRect` anchor guard) are
//! pure functions unit-tested without
//! a display; the GTK wiring around them lives in the [`overlay`] submodule, which is
//! excluded from the coverage ratchet (scripts/coverage.sh / POLICY.md) because it cannot
//! be exercised headlessly — same treatment as `window/editbar/` and `codeview.rs`.
