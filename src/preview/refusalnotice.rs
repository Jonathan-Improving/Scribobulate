//! **A refused image is reported to the document whose render shows it** (TDD 2.23c;
//! Status-notice CAM row 9) — asserted against real renders.
//!
//! Test-only, and carrying `gtk-integration-tests` for the reason `altsuppression`
//! gives: a render needs a `GtkTextBuffer`. The routing from a tab to its window and
//! the notice's wording are pure and tested in `winstate::statusbar`; this asserts the
//! seam between them that no pure test can reach — that the render path carries the
//! tab it is shown in down to the point where the image is refused.
