//! A running pid's executable identity, via `libproc`'s `proc_pidpath`.
//!
//! This is the officially supported, ABI-stable way to ask "what is this pid
//! running" on macOS. The obvious alternative — `sysctl(CTL_KERN, KERN_PROC,
//! KERN_PROC_PID, pid)` filling a `struct kinfo_proc` — is what `ps`/Activity
//! Monitor use internally, but Apple documents that struct's layout as unstable
//! across releases (which is also why the `libc` crate, unlike its
//! FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD siblings, defines no `kinfo_proc` for
//! `target_os = "macos"` at all — there is nothing safe to bind). `proc_pidpath`
//! avoids the whole question: it is a stable `libproc.h` entry point, exported by
//! `libSystem`, which every macOS binary already links, so no extra
//! `#[link(...)]` is needed here (contrast `appearance.rs`'s CoreFoundation
//! import, a separate framework).
//!
//! Supplies a source only — never a liveness verdict of its own (`window::swaprecovery::owner_is_live` decides what a name match means).
