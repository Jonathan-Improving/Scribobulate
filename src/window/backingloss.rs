//! A document whose buffer has become the only copy of it: its file was deleted, or
//! emptied, on disk (TDD 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 15.22, 16.16, 22.18).
//!
//! When a loss begins or ends is decided elsewhere — the monitor's `Deleted` arm, and
//! `winstate::external_change_action` for everything read back from disk. This module
//! applies the answer, so both losses reach every guard through one route: Save's
//! enablement, the ⚠ badge, the close prompt (`TabState::needs_close_prompt`), the
//! crash-recovery snapshot and the status bar's persistent line all re-derive here.
