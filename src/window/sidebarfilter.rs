//! The sidebar filters' window wiring: each pane's search toggle, filter bar and box,
//! the `win.filter-outline` / `win.filter-annotations` commands, and the traffic between
//! the window-shared boxes and the active document's own filter (TDD 12.26–12.29,
//! 20.24–20.25). What a filter *means* is display-free, in `crate::sidebarfilter` and
//! `outline::filter`.
//!
//! # One truth per document, one box per window
//!
//! A filter belongs to the document (`TabState::outline_filter` / `annotations_filter`),
//! like the outline's folding; the bar that edits it is window chrome shared by every
//! tab. The list rebuild reads the document's filter, never the box. The box is re-synced
//! from the document whenever the tab it last reflected is not the active one
//! ([`sync_to_tab`], called from each pane's rebuild), and the box writes back only while
//! it reflects the active tab — the same "whoever is active owns the widget" split the
//! folding memory makes, applied to a widget that holds state of its own.
//!
//! # Why GtkSearchBar, and what it is left to do
//!
//! `GtkSearchBar` (4.6) already does three things the rubric asks for: revealing its box
//! grabs the focus into it, hiding it **clears the box** (so a closed filter hides no
//! rows, TDD 12.27), and a key-capture widget turns typing in the list into a filter
//! (20.25). Its Escape handling is the one piece overridden: GTK closes the bar on any
//! Escape, where the rubric clears a non-empty filter first and closes only an empty one
//! — see [`on_stop_search`] for how the override gets there before GTK's handler.
//!
//! # The toggle button is the bar's, not the command's
//!
//! The header's search toggle is bound to the bar's `search-mode-enabled` (GTK's own
//! search-button pattern), not to `win.filter-*`, because the two differ in one case:
//! the command pressed while the bar is open but the focus is elsewhere FOCUSES the box
//! (the reader asked for the filter — TDD 20.25), while a click on a pressed toggle
//! closes it. One action cannot be both; the button carries the command's shortcut in
//! its tooltip, and every other surface (menu, accelerator, Keyboard Shortcuts window)
//! is the action. The command is never disabled, so there is no sensitivity for the two
//! to disagree about.
