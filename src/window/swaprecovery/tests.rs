/// The user-visible half of TDD 22.15 (does a toast physically appear) was verified
/// once, by hand, against a real full filesystem — it needs a display and a disk that
/// will not fill on demand in CI. But the *logic* underneath it does not, and it is
/// the part most likely to rot silently: a persistent failure re-notifying every few
/// seconds trains the user to dismiss it unread, and a notice that never retracts
/// leaves them believing they are unprotected long after they are not.
///
/// Asserted on the handle rather than on the status text, because the handle IS the
/// mechanism: one outstanding notice means one push, and an unchanged handle across a
/// second failure is precisely "this was a retry, not a transition".
