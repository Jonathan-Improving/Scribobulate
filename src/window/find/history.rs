//! The find bar's **per-field history** — what the reader searched for and what they
//! replaced it with, most recent first.
//!
//! One type for both fields, because they are the same thing twice: a short, ordered,
//! de-duplicated list of strings a reader can get back to. The only thing that differs
//! is which field feeds it, and that is the call site's business.
//!
//! # What counts as an entry
//!
//! A term enters when it is **committed** — Enter, Next/Prev, Replace, Replace All —
//! never per keystroke. That rule lives at the call sites (there is one `record` here
//! and several places that call it), but the reason belongs with the type: the find
//! field searches as you type, so every prefix of every query is a "search" that
//! happened. A history fed per keystroke is `n`, `no`, `not`, `note` — which is the
//! reader's last query four times over, and it pushes everything they actually wanted
//! off the end of a capped list.
//!
//! # Why most-recent-first, de-duplicated
//!
//! A reader reaching for this wants the term they used a minute ago, and the one thing
//! they know about it is that it was recent. Re-committing a term already in the list
//! MOVES it to the front rather than adding a second copy: without that, searching the
//! same two terms alternately fills the whole list with those two.
