//! **The two find engines, measured against each other.**
//!
//! The find bar drives two entirely separate matchers: `GtkSourceSearchContext` over the
//! editor's source buffer, and [`super::matcher::Matcher`] over the preview's three
//! texts. TDD 11.13 and 11.14 claim a query means the *same thing* in both panes. That
//! claim is not provable by reading either implementation — it is a claim about an
//! agreement between them, so the only evidence that settles it is running both over one
//! fixture and comparing the counts.
//!
//! Everything here is therefore a comparison, never an assertion about one engine's
//! output in isolation: a case that hard-codes the number it expects stops being able to
//! tell you the engines have drifted, which is the entire failure this file exists to
//! catch.
//!
//! **This is a probe that became a gate.** Five questions about GtkSourceView's own
//! regular-expression handling decided the matcher's design — how whole-word wraps a
//! pattern, which characters bound a word, which compile flags are set, and what a
//! zero-width pattern does. Each was answered here by measurement rather than by reading
//! GtkSourceView's C source, because a source reading proves what one engine does and
//! this file has to prove what two engines do *together*. The answers are recorded beside
//! the case that measured them.
//!
//! The fixtures are deliberately plain text with no Markdown structure: the subject is
//! the matcher, and a fixture the renderer would transform would measure the renderer
//! too.
