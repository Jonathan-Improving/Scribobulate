//! The preview's matcher — **one** implementation of "where does this query occur in
//! this text", for every text the preview searches.
//!
//! The editor does not use this: `GtkSourceSearchContext` implements the same three
//! options natively against the source buffer, and re-implementing them there would be
//! a second search engine over one buffer. The preview has no such engine, because its
//! matches are not all in a buffer — body text is, table-cell matches live in `GtkLabel`
//! children, and matches inside a collapsed disclosure live only in the document source.
//! Those three used to carry three separate hard-wired matchers, each case-insensitive
//! literal; adding options to three matchers is how the counts in one pane come to
//! disagree with each other, let alone with the other pane.
//!
//! # Why GRegex and not the `regex` crate
//!
//! The editor's regular-expression mode is `GtkSourceSearchSettings:regex-enabled`,
//! which compiles the pattern with GRegex (PCRE). If this file used the `regex` crate
//! the *same pattern typed into the same box* would mean two different things depending
//! on which pane happened to be visible — lookbehind and backreferences accepted in one
//! and rejected in the other, with nothing on screen to explain it. `glib::Regex` binds
//! the same engine, and glib is already a direct dependency, so parity costs nothing.
//!
//! # Byte ranges, always
//!
//! Every function here indexes the `&str` it was handed, in bytes. That is the index
//! space a Pango attribute wants for a cell label, and the caller that needs buffer
//! *character* offsets for body text converts once, at the boundary, where it holds the
//! map. Returning two coordinate systems from one function is how this file's ancestor
//! came to have a byte offset and a char offset in adjacent variables.
