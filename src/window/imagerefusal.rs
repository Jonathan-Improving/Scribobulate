//! Tells the reader why an image is missing when the XInclude screen refused it
//! (TDD 2.23c; Status-notice CAM row 9).
//!
//! The screen runs deep inside a decode, which knows no document. The render that shows
//! the image's placeholder does know its tab, so it hands the screen that tab's id
//! (`imagedecode::report_shown_refusal`) and the screen calls [`schedule`]. One idle
//! later every refusal queued since is reported here, each in the window that holds the
//! document it was refused in — never simply the active window, which may be showing a
//! different document with nothing blocked in it. The window is resolved NOW, from the
//! tab's id, not when the image was refused: a tab can move between windows in between,
//! and a tab closed in between has nobody left to tell, so its notice is dropped.
//!
//! A theme sprite is shown by no document, so its refusal goes to the window in front
//! (resolved now too), said to be the theme's.
//!
//! Refusals coalesce per window: one notice for the window's documents — named when a
//! single document behind the front one, counted when there are several — and one for
//! theme images. The screen records who was told about which content, so a re-render
//! (each keystroke, a zoom step, a reload, a theme reload) reports nothing new; the
//! placeholder's tooltip keeps saying why for as long as it is shown.
