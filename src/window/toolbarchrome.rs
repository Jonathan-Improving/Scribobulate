//! The TOOLBAR LAYOUT — whether the bar is shown (`app.show-toolbar`) and which of
//! its six sections are (`app.show-tbtn-<id>`) — is ONE app-wide preference (TDD
//! 9.17, 9.22): every window shows the same bar, and a change made in any window
//! applies everywhere at once. It was once scoped to a window, and since a window
//! is short-lived the layout never felt saved — the same reasoning that moved the
//! split arrangement app-wide (`window::arrangement`), reached again here.
//!
//! **One layer, unlike the split arrangement.** `arrangement` keeps per-window
//! `win.` forwarders because its two commands are greyed outside split mode and
//! sensitivity is per window, whereas an `app.` action's `enabled` flag is one bit
//! for the whole application. Nothing here is like that: `Show` is always enabled,
//! and a section's enabled is derived from `Show` (I3), which is itself app-wide
//! now. So these seven actions live only on the `Application`, and the View ▸
//! Toolbar menu binds them directly. Adding forwarders would be a second layer with
//! nothing to carry.
//!
//! **Why `Show` moved with the sections rather than staying per window.** The
//! last-section rule (I8 below) reinterprets "hide the final visible section" as
//! "hide the whole bar". With app-wide sections and a per-window `Show`, that
//! reinterpretation would hide the bar in the window the user acted in and leave
//! every other window showing the empty ~2px strip the rule exists to forbid.
//!
//! ## Toolbar invariants (`I1`–`I8`)
//!
//! Referenced by number (`// I3`, `// I5`, …) at their enforcement sites here and
//! in [`super::toolbar`]. The only in-session authority is the GAction *state*:
//! `T` = `app.show-toolbar` (whole bar), `S_i` = `app.show-tbtn-<id>` for
//! `i ∈ TBTN_SECTION_IDS`. Never keep a second in-memory copy — two copies drift,
//! and that drift is the bug class this design forecloses. The persisted
//! [`crate::session::Session`] fields are not a second copy: they are written from
//! these states at close and read back only to seed them at startup.
//!
//! | # | Invariant | Owner |
//! |---|-----------|-------|
//! | I1 | every window's toolbar has `visible == T` | [`apply_to`] |
//! | I2 | every widget in every window's `toolbar_sections[i]` has `visible == S_i` | [`apply_to`] |
//! | I3 | `show-tbtn-<i>.enabled == T` (all six, derived) | [`apply_everywhere`] |
//! | I4 | `show-tbtn-<i>.state == S_i`; never written by the reconcile | the item's own toggle |
//! | I5 | every window's min-width reflects `T` and `{S_i}` | [`apply_to`] (derived) |
//! | I6 | every *command* action's `enabled` is a function of mode/focus/zoom-ladder ONLY, never of `T`/`S_i` | the command-action machinery; chrome never touches it |
//! | I7 | section left-to-right order is always canonical (`file,edit,format,view,split,zoom`) | static construction: append once, `set_visible`-toggle, never remove/re-append |
//! | I8 | no empty-bar state is reachable interactively | the last-section veto in [`add_section_action`] |
//!
//! Three orthogonal axes — conflating any two is a bug: (1) visibility (`T`,
//! `{S_i}`); (2) section menu-item *enabled* (`= T`, derived); (3) individual
//! command-button sensitivity (owned by mode/focus/zoom). "Disable" is never
//! "uncheck": hiding the bar sets each item `enabled=false` (I3) but leaves its
//! `state` (I4), so re-showing restores the exact prior config.
//!
//! Held on the `GtkApplication` rather than in a `thread_local`, so each test
//! application starts from its own value and no test can leak a layout into the
//! next (POLICY: a test restores any process-global state it installs).

/// its widest SINGLE visible item, never the sum of the visible ones, because a
/// [`ToolbarWrapBox`] moves what does not fit onto another row instead of demanding
/// a wider window (TDD 9.38).
///
/// **Which term wins is the whole design, and today it is the backstop.** Every

/// by content are character-capped, so the toolbar's minimum stays well under
/// `MIN_WINDOW_WIDTH` however many sections are shown — meaning the toolbar no
/// longer sets the floor at all, and a narrow display fits the window whatever the
/// reader has ticked. `no_chrome_sets_the_windows_width_floor_above_the_backstop`
/// is the guard, and it is the inequality to preserve: the moment the toolbar's own
/// minimum climbs back above the backstop, this seam starts constraining the window
/// again and a narrow screen stops fitting.
///
/// Hiding a section therefore still lowers the content-derived term, but the reader
/// sees no change in how narrow the window can be dragged — the backstop was already
/// the binding constraint. That is the intended end state, not a regression.
///
/// The `queue_resize` is so that re-measure is not deferred arbitrarily; that is all
/// this seam needs to do. **It is not a request to GROW the frame.** On X11 a
/// mapped window is resized up when its minimum rises above its current width; on
/// macOS it is not, and whatever caused the rise is drawn outside the surface
/// instead — which is why nothing in this toolbar is allowed an unbounded width.
///
/// **Active-shrink** (auto-contracting the already-open window when a section is

/// under the user is jarring UX, and the user may have widened the window on
/// purpose. Note: a synchronous `toolbar.measure(Horizontal, -1)` right after
