//! The startup crash-recovery pass: scan the swap directory, decide what each snapshot
//! means, and put the user's unsaved work back.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Runs **after** session restore has built the windows and tabs, and **before** the
//! deferred pre-render pump starts warming background tabs. After restore, because a
//! recovered document usually belongs in a tab that already exists; before the pump,
//! because applying content into a tab the pump is mid-render on would be a race for no
//! benefit.
//!
//! # Header-first, session-as-a-hint
//!
//! The set of documents to recover is decided **entirely from the swap headers**. The
//! restored session only says *where to put* a recovered document, never *whether* there
//! is one. Reversing that — session-first, header as confirmation — would make a session
//! file that lost a tab silently discard that tab's unsaved work, which is the exact
//! failure this feature exists to prevent. See `swapfile`'s self-sufficiency principle.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating because they look like edge cases and are not:
//!
//! - A swap file naming a document the session never restored is **still recovered**,
//!   into a tab opened for it. The crash landing between the snapshot write and the
//!   session write is an ordinary outcome, not an anomaly.
//! - A restored tab with no swap file is **clean, always**. Absence of a snapshot is
//!   never evidence that a snapshot was lost.
//!
//! # What is never touched
//!
//! Anything that is not ours. The state directory is a shared place, and a file whose
//! first line is not our magic is left exactly as it was found — logged, never parsed,
//! never deleted. A file that *is* ours but is damaged is also kept: it may be the only
//! surviving copy of the user's work, and a human can still read it.

/// answers `true` only on positive confirmation, and `false` wherever it cannot tell.

/// `--new-instance`, or where there is no single-instance transport) could each recover
/// the other's live snapshot into a tab of its own — a bounded limitation, and preferred
/// to guessing at liveness.
///
/// **The three confirming arms answer the same question by different mechanisms, and the
/// Windows one is not the shape the other two are.** `/proc` and `proc_pidpath` both stop
/// answering once the process is gone, so on those platforms "the name resolved" already
/// implies "the process exists". On Windows a terminated process still answers
/// `OpenProcess` for as long as any handle to it is held, so existence has to be
/// established separately — see `platform::win32::process` for the measurements and for
