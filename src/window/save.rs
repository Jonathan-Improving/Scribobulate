/// (MEASURED, gtk-4.22.4 `gdk/win32/gdksurface-win32.c:1238`), so on the native
/// Win32 frame every one of these dialogs showed a lone `.` beside the app icon,

/// It is set on **every** platform rather than under `#[cfg(windows)]`: POLICY's

/// consequence elsewhere is small and stated rather than hidden — where
/// `gtk-dialogs-use-header` is on (GNOME), the dialog's header gains a

/// # Why writes for one document are serialised
