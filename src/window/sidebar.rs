//! `SidebarPane` — the shared *chrome* of a sidebar section.
//!
//! The outline and the annotations viewer are two independent lists that live stacked
//! in one sidebar. Their **chrome** is identical — a bold `.heading` caption, optional
//! header action buttons, an in-pane close **×**, a separator, and a scroller whose
//! inner child is swapped on every document change — so it is abstracted here and both
//! panes use it unchanged. Their **internals differ in kind** (the outline is a
//! `GtkTreeListModel` tree keyed by positional index; the annotations list is a flat
//! `ListStore` keyed by span identity) and are deliberately **not** shared: a generic
//! covering both would need a tree/flat switch and an index-or-identity key union, which
//! is more complex than the two concrete builders and hides the one difference that most
//! matters. So this seam is the chrome only.
//!
//! Ownership note: the pane's `root` box's `:visible` is driven by its toggle action
//! (`win.outline` / `win.annotations`) through
//! [`reconcile_sidebar_visibility`](super::annotations_nav::reconcile_sidebar_visibility),
//! never set here — this module only *builds* the widgets.
