//! Front matter: the metadata block a document may open with, and the event stream
//! every walk reads it through. Pure, GTK-free, unit-tested.
//!
//! # What the parser does with it, and why that is not good enough
//!
//! CommonMark has no notion of front matter, and this build deliberately does not
//! enable pulldown-cmark's `ENABLE_YAML_STYLE_METADATA_BLOCKS` (see [`super::normalize`]
//! — an enabled-but-unhandled extension DROPS its construct, ScrAP-78). So the parser
//! reads `---` on line 1 as a thematic break, and the closing `---` as a **setext
//! underline** for everything between them. MEASURED on this project's own
//! `.claude/agents/dev.md`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   0..4    Rule
//!   4..197  Start(Heading { level: H2, … })   <- the ENTIRE front matter block
//!           Text("name: dev") SoftBreak Text("description: …") …
//! ```
//!
//! A horizontal rule and one enormous heading — which the outline sidebar then lists
//! as a real heading, because it walks the same events. The block is not silently
//! dropped, so this is not the ScrAP-78 failure; it is worse-looking than the literal
//! text TDD 2.25 used to promise for it, and it invents document structure that the
//! author never wrote.
//!
//! # What this module does instead
//!
//! [`scan`] answers *where* the front matter is, as byte extents, and nothing else.
//! [`events`] is the walk seam every parse site reads a document through: given
//! [`Show::Omitted`] it parses the document from **after** the closing fence and shifts
//! every range back into whole-document space, so the front matter is simply not there
//! for the outline and the exports; given [`Show::AsDisclosure`] it prepends the nine
//! events of a `<details>` wrapping a fenced code block, each pointing at the real
//! source bytes it stands for.
//!
//! **Synthetic events, not a rewritten document.** The preview's source map, the
//! char-precise copymap and the fold keys are all built from event source ranges, so a
//! rewrite that inserted `<details>` text would shift every offset below it and put the
//! editor and the preview into different coordinate systems. The nine events below tile
//! the front matter's real bytes exactly — opening fence line, body, closing fence line
//! — with no gap and no overlap, so a copy across the block reproduces what the author
//! typed, and scroll-sync lands on the line they are looking at.
//!
//! Nothing in the renderer knows this module exists: the events are indistinguishable
//! from the ones an author writing the `<details>` by hand would produce, which is what
//! "reuse the code-block render inside a disclosure" has to mean if the two are ever to
//! stay in step.
