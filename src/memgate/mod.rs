//! Per-render memory-growth gating (TDD 6.6–6.12).
//!
//! Two halves of one class, catching disjoint failures:
//!
//! * [`growth`] — after discarding warm-up, a sample series may step up at most
//!   once and must retain no more than a per-platform ceiling. Growth over many
//!   repetitions is the only honest shape: a single-shot "render, free, assert
//!   the number came back" cannot pass on a correct implementation, because
//!   freed pages stay with the allocator on every platform this project
//!   delivers to.
//! * [`footprint`] — one sampler, three `cfg` bodies. The field is named
//!   **footprint**, never RSS: `/proc` VmRSS, macOS `ri_phys_footprint` and
//!   Windows `WorkingSetSize` are not the same quantity.
//!
//! The GTK drivers that *produce* the samples live in [`gtk`] (6.6–6.9, and
//! 6.7's still-image half) and [`playback`] (6.10, and 6.7 extended to the
//! animation state), compiled only under
//! the `memory-gates` feature, so pipeline step 5 never runs either. The
//! decision cores here run as ordinary unit tests (step 4) and stay inside
//! the coverage ratchet.
