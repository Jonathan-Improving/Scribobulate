/// Per-platform bounds for [`super::growth::assert_no_growth`], in bytes.

/// The one owner of both numbers, and [`assert_bounded`] the only reader.
///
/// **Both are derived from clean traces, and the run log carries the numbers
/// they were derived from.** `residual_bytes` sits above the growth a clean run
/// leaves unexplained by its single largest allocation, and far below what a
/// per-render climb leaves: ScrAP-351's leak is ~1.05 MB per render at the test
/// fixture's scale (~12 MB on a real document's image), which over a ten-sample
/// window — nine rises, less the largest — leaves ~8.4 MB of residual, about 2.7
/// times the bound rather than beside it, so no host's churn sits near the
/// decision. `total_bytes` sits above the largest one-time step
/// ever measured (~12.6 MB on the Linux CI runner, before `measuring()` stopped
/// the kernel's huge-page collapse from producing it) and far below what any
/// climb totals.
///
/// Measured clean traces, worst of the six gates in each run — the playback gate
/// on every host, being the only one with a live frame clock:
///
/// | host | total growth | largest rise | residual |
/// |------|--------------|--------------|----------|
/// | Linux development host, 4 runs | 1.04 MB | 0.70-0.77 MB | 0.27 MB |
/// | Linux CI runner, huge-page collapse armed | 12.98 MB | 12.08 MB | **0.86 MB** |
/// | Linux CI runner, collapse disabled | −0.38 MB | 0.38 MB | −0.77 MB |
/// | macOS CI runner | 0.31 MB | 0.31 MB | 0 |
/// | Windows CI runner | 0.26 MB | 0.53 MB | −0.28 MB |
/// | macOS seat, per-stretch rule, 11 runs | 1.2–2.3 MB | 0.5–1.6 MB | **0.02–1.25 MB** |
///
/// **The per-stretch rule (see `growth::residual_growth`) raised the bound from 2 MiB to
/// 3 MiB** (operator decision, 2026-10-02). Judging every stretch rather than first to
/// last stops a fall from hiding a climb, and it also stops a fall from hiding slow
/// drift: the macOS playback gate's residual went from ~0.15 MB to as much as 1.25 MB
/// (59% of 2 MiB), mostly over stretches spanning nearly the whole window. At 3 MiB that
/// reading sits at ~40% while the fixture leak below still clears the bound ~2.7x.
///
/// **The armed CI row is the one that decided the bound**, and it is the trace
/// this predicate exists for: a ~12 MB one-time step, at a different sample each
/// run, which the half-mean this replaced reported as an 8.65 MB climb. It was
/// never an allocation — `khugepaged` filling heap pages the process already
/// owned (see `measuring()`) — but a step the program did not make is exactly
/// the shape the predicate must pass. Its 0.86 MB of residual is the worst
/// clean reading under the end-to-end rule, and it sits 3.6x under the bound while the
/// smallest leak the gate must catch — ScrAP-351's ~1.05 MB per render over a
/// ten-sample window, ~8.4 MB of residual — sits about 2.7x over it. Windows shows the bound must tolerate a NEGATIVE
/// residual: its footprint falls across the window, which is not growth.
