//! The gate between this module and gdk-pixbuf's loader chain: every hand-off of
//! encoded bytes to a loader takes a [`Screened`], and the only way to get one is to
//! pass [`super::xinclude`]'s screen. A refusal is logged here, and remembered so the
//! window can say why an image is missing (TDD 2.23c).
//!
//! The screen knows the image, never the document: a decode carries no document. So the
//! notice is fed by whoever SHOWS the image ([`report_shown_refusal`]) — the render that
//! anchors its placeholder, which knows the tab it renders for, or the theme, for a
//! sprite — and this module keeps the ledger of who has already been told about which
//! content.
