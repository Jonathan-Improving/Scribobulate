//! [`AnchoredSpan`] — a byte range into a document that survives the document
//! changing underneath it. The one held reference this application has.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A control is built at one instant and acted on at another. Between those two
//! instants the document can change: the user types, an undo lands, a save flushes
//! the editor into the source, or the split-mode live re-render re-scans. A plain
//! `Range<usize>` captured at build time does not survive any of that — and applying
//! a stale one is not a near-miss, it is *destructive*, because string surgery at the
//! wrong offsets deletes whatever happens to be there and leaves the markup half-open.
//! Out of bounds it is worse still: a raw slice **panics**, and a panic inside a
//! GTK signal handler aborts the process.
//!
//! So a range is never carried across time on its own. It is carried together
//! with **the text that occupied it**, which is what makes it re-findable: the
//! text is the identity, the offset is only a hint about where to look.
//!
//! # The resolution rule
//!
//! 1. If the captured text is still exactly at the captured offset, that is the
//!    answer — the overwhelmingly common case, and it costs one comparison. The fast
//!    path is not merely an optimisation: it also disambiguates, so several identical
//!    constructs in an unmoved document each resolve to themselves.
//! 2. Otherwise the [`Ambiguity`] policy the capture declared decides, and it is the
//!    ONLY thing that varies between the constructs using this type.
//! 3. If the text is gone entirely, there is no answer: `None`.
//!
//! # `None` obliges the caller to RE-DERIVE, never to do nothing
//!
//! This is the contract that makes the type safe to reuse, and it was learnt from the
//! one construct that got it wrong. A held reference that gives up whenever the
//! document moved makes the feature useless in exactly the session where it is most
//! used — and giving up *silently* leaves a live control on screen that does nothing,
//! with no cause visible where it was caused (a save) or where it was felt (a click).
//! So a caller that cannot resolve rebuilds the view the reference was minted by; the
//! reader's next gesture then lands on a control that names the current document. The
//! cost of the wrong answer is a wasted rebuild, never a dead feature.
//!
//! Pure and display-free by construction: it holds a `String`, a `Range` and a
//! one-byte policy, so every rule above is exhaustively testable with plain
//! `cargo test`.
