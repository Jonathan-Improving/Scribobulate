//! Which outline nodes the reader has collapsed, in terms that survive a rebuild.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `refresh_outline` throws the whole outline widget away and builds a new one — on a tab
//! switch, a view-mode switch, a reload, and every debounced keystroke in live preview. The
//! `GtkTreeListModel` and every `GtkTreeListRow` in it are destroyed with it, and GTK caches
//! nothing: collapsing a row *frees* its subtree rather than remembering it was open
//! (ScrAP-84). So expansion cannot be recovered from the widgets after the fact. It has to be
//! recorded as data while the reader is acting, and re-applied to the rows the next build
//! produces.
//!
//! # Why the COLLAPSED set, and not the expanded one
//!
//! The outline opens fully expanded — the model is built `autoexpand=false` and then force-
//! opened, so "expanded" is the default state of every node that has never been touched.
//! Recording the collapsed set therefore makes an unrecognised node fall back to the default
//! **by construction**: a heading this type has never heard of is simply not in the set, and
//! stays open. Recording the expanded set would invert that — every node the reader edited
//! into existence would arrive collapsed, and the failure would grow with the document.
//!
//! # Why a title path, and what it costs
//!
//! A node needs a name that means the same thing before and after a rebuild, and the three
//! candidates already in the tree are all positional: `doc_index` is an index into a list
//! every render rebuilds (`outline_nav.rs` calls it "the weakest reference there is"),
//! `src_offset` moves when any character above it is typed, and a child-index path shifts the
//! moment a heading is inserted above a sibling. All three survive a tab switch and corrupt
//! under an edit — and an edit is the common case here, because live preview rebuilds the
//! outline as the reader types.
//!
//! A path of heading TITLES inverts that trade. Inserting, deleting or reordering *other*
//! headings leaves a node's path untouched, so the sections the reader collapsed stay
//! collapsed. **Renaming a heading — or any of its ancestors — loses its entry, and the node
//! re-expands.** That is the deliberate direction to fail in: a section that springs open is
//! a visible, self-correcting annoyance, where a stale key silently collapses the *wrong*
//! section and the reader cannot tell why.
//!
//! [`PathStep::nth`] separates siblings that share a title, so two "Notes" subsections under
//! one parent are distinct keys rather than one key that moves both together.
