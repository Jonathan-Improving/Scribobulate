//! Resolve an [`ImageResolution`] into a decoded texture, through this crate's one
//! image cache ([`super::get_or_fetch`]) and its one decode choke point
//! ([`crate::imagedecode`]).
//!
//! Relocated here from `renderer::start` (WP6b, sdd/PLAN.memory-gates.md) because it
//! is fundamentally cache-client code — every function here exists to decide what to
//! hand [`super::get_or_fetch`] and what to do with what comes back — and because that
//! file was already well past POLICY's soft 500-line limit; this module is a better
//! home for logic that grows with the cache's own contract. `renderer::start`
//! re-exports [`load_texture`] and [`LoadedImage`] at their old path so nothing
//! outside this crate's image-loading code needed to change.
//!
//! **Local images** go through [`load_local`]: a path+mtime+length+size cache so a
//! re-render does not decode again. A local file is always admitted first
//! ([`crate::imagedecode::read_local`] — a regular file, within the configured byte
//! cap) and its CONTENT, never its name, decides whether it takes the vector branch
//! (dimensions from [`crate::imagedecode::probe_vector_dimensions`]) or the ordinary
//! raster one (below) — see [`load_local`]'s own doc comment for why (Finding 1 /
//! TDD 2.23b). Raster decode is [`crate::imagedecode`], the application's one choke
//! point (WP6, sdd/PLAN.memory-gates.md): it sniffs by content and routes WebP/GIF/APNG
//! to `richimg` — never `Texture::from_file`, which leaked ~12 MB/call on a valid
//! animated WebP and SIGSEGVed on a truncated one (`Pixbuf::from_file` errored
//! outright and was never a fallback — ScrAP-146 / GTK4Rs/AP-66, now superseded by
//! this route for every format it claims).
//!
//! **Remote images** are fetched by [`crate::imagefetch`], not by GIO — a
//! `gio::File::for_uri("https://…")` needs a GVfs http backend that claims the scheme,
//! which exists on the Linux desktop and nowhere else, so that route rendered
//! nothing at all on macOS (ScrAP-292). The bytes then go through the same
//! [`crate::imagedecode`] choke point as a local file. `Refused`/`Missing` never
//! load. Remote fetches block the main thread for the request (accepted for the
//! opt-in "Show Unsafe Images" path, ScrAP-34, its 34a half).
//!
//! ## Animation on a cache hit (TDD 27.1, WP6b)
//!
//! A cache MISS always resolves its own animation bytes directly (see
//! [`decode_local_raster`] and [`load_remote_texture`]). A cache HIT answers from
//! [`super::CachedTexture::animation`]'s hint: [`super::AnimationHint::Remote`]
//! already carries the retained bytes, no further work needed; a local
//! [`super::AnimationHint::Local`] carries none (see `imagecache`'s module doc), so
//! [`recover_local_animation`] runs — free when a live picture still holds the
//! bytes, a bounded re-read otherwise.

/// pixels against 19.2‰ for a bilinear upscale of the same drawing, which is the ~3×
/// ratio a stretched 1px edge predicts.
///
/// **Why `Texture::from_file` cannot do this.** GTK 4.6 decodes only PNG/JPEG/TIFF
/// itself and falls through to `gdk_pixbuf_new_from_stream` for everything else, which
/// passes the loader a **no-op size callback** — so a scalable source is asked for its
/// natural size and the caller is given no way to say otherwise (researcher-sourced,
/// gdk-pixbuf-io.c). The size has to be an input to the decode, and this is the entry
/// point that takes one.
///
/// And a correctly-sized texture is the only route to a sharp result at this floor: GSK
/// 4.6 sets no cairo filter at all on a texture node, so an enlargement gets cairo's
/// default `FILTER_GOOD` (bilinear quality) whatever the renderer, and
/// `gtk_snapshot_append_scaled_texture` does not exist until 4.10 (cf. `sprite.rs`,
/// which pre-resamples for the same reason).
///
/// **The target size is where the pixel bound has to be applied for a vector source,
/// and this is a NEW exposure the re-render introduces.** A `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`
/// document probes as 576 pixels and passes any cap trivially, then gets asked for a
/// raster nine times larger than the layout — natural size bounds nothing here.
/// [`cap_raster`] is therefore applied to the TARGET, before the decode.
///
/// One axis is passed and the other left `-1`: with `preserve_aspect_ratio` the loader
/// derives the second itself, which removes any chance of this function's own rounding
/// deciding which axis binds. That is the whole reason — passing both axes is NOT a
/// letterbox hazard here, measured identically on three hosts by three seats; the
/// letterboxing librsvg really does perform belongs to `preserve_aspect_ratio = false`,
/// which this never passes.
///
/// `target` is the size to render AT, already capped by the caller — which is also the
/// caller that decided a re-render is worth doing at all (`zoomed == intrinsic` means
/// zoom 1.0, where a second decode buys nothing over the natural-size one). This
