//! Reading session files written by SUPERSEDED schema versions.
//!
//! ## The shape every migration here shares
//!
//! Read this once and the per-version sections below need only say what MOVED.
//!
//! There are two kinds. A **v1** file is a wholly different shape, so it REPLACES
//! the parse ([`from_v1`]). Every later shape is the current one plus keys that
//! have since moved, so it is parsed normally and then ADDED to
//! ([`apply_superseded`]) — serde ignores unknown fields, so the relocated keys
//! simply drop out of the ordinary parse rather than failing it, which would
//! discard every window to recover a chrome flag.
//!
//! Each additive migration is driven by its own SEPARATE, infallible, all-`Option`
//! re-parse of the same text. Two properties follow, and together they are why
//! there is no "which version is this file?" test anywhere below:
//!
//! - **`Option` makes ABSENT distinguishable from `false`.** A file predating one
//!   of an old shape's keys migrates the keys it actually has, instead of reading a
//!   missing key as "switched off". Give any of these fields a derived `bool`
//!   default and an old file starts hiding chrome the user never hid. It also means
//!   a file that cannot be read for its old chrome loses only the chrome, never a
//!   window.
//! - **A migration is therefore INERT on a file the current writer produced**,
//!   which carries none of the superseded keys. Calling them all unconditionally is
//!   already a no-op there, so a version test would be unfalsifiable decoration.
//!
//! The corollary is what to watch when adding a schema version: that inertness
//! holds only while the current writer emits none of the keys a reader here looks
//! for. Reintroducing an old key NAME at the level an old shape used it — which v6
//! did, deliberately, for the toolbar — makes that reader fire on files we write
//! ourselves. That is safe only while the two agree exactly, and the honest
//! response is to delete the redundant reader rather than to reason about the
//! overlap.
//!
//! ## v1 — one flat window, no `windows` key
//!
//! The v1 schema described a single window with a single tab. It migrates to one
//! window with one tab (no path — v1 never recorded one), carrying over its flat
//! width/height/zoom/view-mode/split/unsafe-images fields. [`from_v1`] carries why
//! the detection is a direct test for the `windows` key rather than a hopeful
//! parse.
//!
//! ## v2 — chrome at the top level, app-wide
//!
//! v2 kept `show_toolbar` / `show_statusbar` / `toolbar_sections` /
//! `outline_visible` at the TOP level. The status bar and outline are now per
//! window, so [`migrate_v2_app_wide_chrome`] copies those two onto EVERY restored
//! window — the only answer that reproduces what the user actually saw, since a v2
//! session had exactly one chrome answer for all of its windows and no per-window
//! value was ever recorded. The other two need no migration at all: v6 put the
//! toolbar back at the top level under the same names, so they parse straight into
//! [`Session`].
//!
//! ## v3, v4 — the split arrangement per window / per tab
//!
//! v3 kept both halves per TAB; v4 moved the pane order (`split_swap`) into each
//! window's `chrome` and left the orientation (`split_vertical`) per tab. Both are
//! now one app-wide value, because tabs and windows are both short-lived and a
//! preference that dies with either never feels saved.
//! [`migrate_pre_v5_split_arrangement`] recovers it from **the first window's
//! ACTIVE tab** — the arrangement the user was last looking at, the writer listing
//! windows most-recently-focused first (`app.windows()`). Never a majority vote
//! across windows or tabs: that would sometimes restore an arrangement the user was
//! not looking at.
//!
//! ## v3, v4, v5 — the toolbar per window
//!
//! v3–v5 kept `show_toolbar` and `toolbar_sections` in each window's `chrome`
//! table. Both are now one app-wide value, for the reason that moved the split
//! arrangement in v5. [`migrate_pre_v6_toolbar`] recovers them from **the first
//! window**, on the same most-recently-focused rule and for the same reason.
