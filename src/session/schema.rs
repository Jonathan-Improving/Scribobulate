//! The on-disk session SHAPE: the structs `session.toml` serialises to and from,
//! and the scope each value is held at.
//!
//! **Scope is the one thing to get right here**, and it is a decision per FIELD
//! rather than a property of the type:
//!
//! | Scope | Held by | Examples |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | App-wide | [`Session`] itself | reading theme, animations, split arrangement, toolbar layout |
//! | Per window | [`ChromeSession`] inside [`WindowSession`] | status bar, sidebars, geometry, zoom |
//! | Per tab | [`TabSession`] | path, view mode, unsafe images, find match options and history |
//!
//! A field filed at the wrong scope neither fails to compile nor fails a round
//! trip — it simply answers the wrong question later, and every such move so far
//! has cost a schema version (see [`super::migrate`]). Each type's scope note
//! records what was decided and why, so the next field lands beside a reason
//! rather than beside a guess.
//!
//! **FIELD ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING** in three of these structs — for TOML, not for
//! Rust: a table's scalar keys must all be emitted before any sub-table, or
//! `toml::to_string` fails with `ValueAfterTable` and [`super::save`] log-and-drops
//! the whole session. Each affected struct says so at its own declaration.
