//! Cross-session persistence of window/tab layout (TDD 7.2).
//!
//! Stored as a tiny TOML file under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/scribobulate/` (state, not
//! config — this is machine-generated UI state, not user configuration). A
//! STANDALONE window close rewrites the whole file from the current set of live
//! windows (`window::lifecycle::persist_all_windows_session`), so the file always
//! reflects "every window still open right before this one closed" — not just the
//! closing window's own state. A COORDINATED quit (`window::quit_all_windows`)
//! instead snapshots all windows ONCE and FREEZES [`save`] (see [`FROZEN`]) while
//! it closes each window in turn, because `app.windows()` shrinks across that
//! sequence and per-close writes would otherwise leave only the last window
//! (GTK4Rs/AP-113, TDD 15.10).
//!
//! ## Schema (v6)
//!
//! One [`Session`] holds the app-wide values — `preview_theme` (one CSS provider),
//! `play_animations`, the split-pane ARRANGEMENT (`split_swap`, `split_vertical`:
//! one app-wide preference since v5, TDD 7.3) and, since v6, the TOOLBAR LAYOUT
//! (`show_toolbar`, `toolbar_sections`: TDD 9.22) — plus a
//! `Vec<WindowSession>`, one per open window:
//! its geometry, its **one shared zoom level** (zoom is a window-level
//! accessibility setting, not a per-tab one — operator
//! decision), its own [`ChromeSession`] (status bar / sidebar visibility — per
//! window, not app-wide), and a `Vec<TabSession>` (path,
//! view mode, unsafe-images toggle) plus which tab was active. No tab content is persisted
//! (only its `path`, if any) — an unsaved untitled tab restores blank, matching
//! `create_tab_in_window`'s own blank-tab convention (`window::restore`).
//!
//! ## Layout of this module
//!
//! | Submodule | Owns |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`schema`] | the structs the file serialises to and from, and the SCOPE each value is held at |
//! | [`migrate`] | reading files written by superseded schema versions |
//! | [`statedir`] | where the state directory is and how it is created, privately |
//!
//! What stays HERE is the traffic between them: the read/write entry points, the
//! parse that decides which shape a file is, and the save freeze.
