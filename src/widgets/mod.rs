//! Custom GTK4 widgets built for Scribobulate.
//!
//! This is the home for every hand-written `GtkWidget` subclass (and the plain
//! Rust façades that pair with them). Each widget lives in its own submodule
//! directory so its GObject glue, its pure decision/layout arithmetic (a
//! GTK-free, unit-tested `layout` module — see POLICY §coverage gate), and any
//! façade split across focused files rather than one monolith:
//!
//! - [`table`] — `ScribTableWidget`, the churn-free anchored Markdown-table
//!   widget (a `ConstantSize` widget with cached cell rects; see GTK4Rs/AP-23).
//! - [`tab`] — the `GtkNotebook`-free tab strip (`TabBar` + the `TabView`
//!   façade); kills the GTK4Rs/AP-60 crash class and adds per-tab close/context-menu.
//! - [`comment_entry`] — `CommentEntry`, the single annotation comment
//!   entry + Save pair shared by all three annotation surfaces, wiring every
//!   commit route once.
//! - [`rule`] — `SpriteRule`, the horizontal rule when a theme tiles a sprite across
//!   it (TDD 18.31). Built only where the theme states one; the flat rule stays the
//!   stock `GtkSeparator` it has always been.
//! - [`sprite_icon`] — `SpriteIcon`, a theme sprite drawn at a fixed square size (the
//!   disclosure indicator's sprite shape), so an animated one plays (TDD 27.9).
//! - [`textfield`] — the constructors every `GtkEntry`/`GtkSearchEntry` in the
//!   application comes from, so the two silent follow-ups a hand-built field owes
//!   (accessible name; macOS word navigation) cannot be forgotten one surface at a
//!   time.

/// Tile `tex` across `rect` at the texture's NATURAL size, with the grid anchored so the
/// pattern travels with the document.
///
/// **One spelling of one operation.** The `push_repeat` / `append_texture` / `pop`
/// sequence was copy-pasted three times (the heading band, the blockquote bar, the rule
/// widget) with two undeclared variations between them: the two `codeview` sites anchored
/// the tile grid at the rect while the rule widget anchored at the origin, and only the
/// rule widget guarded against a zero or negative dimension. `sdd/THEMING.md` already
/// described the rule widget as using "the same `push_repeat`/`append_texture` pair every
/// other sprite in this vocabulary is painted with" — a claim about a shared seam that
/// did not exist until now.
///
/// # The anchor, and why it is not a parameter
///
/// The tile grid is anchored at `(rect.x(), N * tile_h)` — x from the rect, y at the
/// DOCUMENT-origin grid line at or above the rect — and every tiling site in the tree
/// wants that pair, so it is baked in rather than chosen per call. It replaced a
/// `TileOrigin` enum whose two answers were "the rect's own top-left" and `(0, 0)`; both
/// were wrong, in different ways, and the enum's own documentation asserted the opposite
/// of what each did.
///
/// **What the anchor actually means** (researcher-verified against GTK 4.6.9):
/// `gtk_snapshot_push_repeat` (`gtksnapshot.c:787-807`) `ensure_affine`-bakes the current
/// 2-D affine into *both* `bounds` and `child_bounds`, and the cairo repeat node
/// (`gskrendernodeimpl.c:3399-3432`) sets its source-surface matrix from
/// `-child_bounds.origin`. So `child_bounds` is simultaneously the sample window and the
/// phase anchor, absolute in that baked space: the phase at a point `P` is
/// `(P - child_origin) mod tile`. "Anchored relative to the decoration" is not a mode the
/// API offers — it is only what you get by choosing `child_origin == bounds.origin`.
///
/// **Why y must be the document's grid, not the rect's top.** Inside a `GtkTextView`'s
/// `snapshot_layer` the current transform is already `translate(-xoffset, -yoffset)`
/// (`gtktextview.c:5871-5873`), and a pure translate bakes into the rects rather than
/// wrapping a transform node — so a `y` congruent to `0` modulo `tile_h` bakes to
/// `-yoffset` modulo `tile_h`, putting plate row `yoffset % tile_h` at the top of the
/// viewport, a phase that travels with the text.
/// Anchoring at the rect cannot do this, because `codeview::geometry::span_card_y_extent`
/// returns `top = vtop` whenever a span begins above the visible range — the normal case
/// for anything taller than the pane. The anchor then *is* the viewport, and the pattern
/// is nailed to the screen while the text scrolls under it. MEASURED on the blockquote
/// bar before the fix: the bar column was pixel-identical (AE=0) across a 176px scroll —
/// 7.3 tile periods — while the text column at the same rows differed by over 22,000
/// pixels, absolute tile phase reading 6.34 in every frame. After: 6.34 / 19.34 / 8.34 /
/// 22.34 at scroll offsets 576 / 635 / 694 / 752, matching `(6.34 - Δscroll) mod 24`
/// exactly at all three steps.
///
/// **Why x must come from the rect.** The `(0, 0)` spelling samples the tile at
/// `rect.x() % tile_w`, slicing the sprite horizontally wherever a decoration does not
/// begin on a tile boundary — which a bar at the view's left margin generally does not.
/// The two halves are independent: fixing the scroll phase with `(0, 0)` trades a
/// vertical bug for a visible vertical seam down the bar's left edge. The rule widget's
/// rect is `(0, 0, w, h)`, so both spellings coincide there and its pixels are unchanged.
///
/// Grid alignment to each decoration's own top is deliberately NOT offered: it needs
/// `decoration_top % tile_h`, and for a viewport-clamped span that remainder is exactly
/// the off-screen unvalidated-iter read ScrAP-22 bans. A grid line is a coordinate, not
/// an iter, so this anchor needs no such read.
///
/// **Why the anchor is the nearest grid line and not the literal `0`.** The phase half of
/// this anchor is GTK4Rs/AP-315, whose prescribed `child_origin = (rect.x(), 0.0)` is what
/// this tree shipped and what the ceiling below breaks; that entry does not yet carry the
/// ceiling, so nothing here cites it for one. Same grid — a
/// multiple of `tile_h` is congruent to `0`, so the phase is bit-identical — but the
/// literal `0` puts `child_bounds` an unbounded distance from `bounds`, and past
/// **32768 px of separation the Cairo renderer draws the repeat node as NOTHING**. The
/// decoration does not degrade to its flat sibling and emits no warning; it simply is
/// not there, on every tiled decoration at once, from one scroll position onward.
/// MEASURED (GTK 4.6.9, `GSK_RENDERER=cairo`, this tree): a bar at buffer y 32670 tiles,
/// the same bar at 32724 does not; `append_color`, `append_texture` and
/// `append_linear_gradient` at the same coordinates are all unaffected, so this is
/// specific to the repeat node. 32768 is `2^15` — the ceiling of pixman's 16.16
/// `pixman_fixed_t`, which the repeating source pattern's offset is converted to.
/// A rendered `sdd/TDD.md` is ~107,000 px tall at a 1000 px pane, so roughly two thirds
/// of it lost every sprite; the reported symptom was a blockquote plate that "stops
/// partway down the file", and the boundary moves with pane width and preview zoom
/// because those are what decide the buffer y of any given line.
///
/// `floor` and not `round`: the anchor must be at or ABOVE the rect, so the tile row the
/// rect's top samples is the one the grid actually places there.
///
/// Natural size, not stretched: 1:1 pixels need no filter, and GSK 4.6's
/// `append_texture` filters linearly with no choice (the variant that takes one is 4.10,
/// GTK4Rs/AP-114). Tiling also means one cached texture per reference instead of one per
/// decoration width, which a window resize would otherwise mint by the hundred.
///
/// The same tile rect goes to `push_repeat` and to `append_texture`, and must: they bake
/// through the same affine, and giving them different origins leaves the first
/// `child_origin.y - texture_origin.y` rows of every tile empty.
///
/// A zero or negative dimension — on either the rect or the texture — paints NOTHING
/// rather than asking GSK for a degenerate repeat node. Two of the three call sites had

    /// y must be ON the document's own grid (a multiple of the tile height — what
    /// survives the viewport clamp and keeps the phase travelling with the text), y must
    /// also be WITHIN one tile of the rect (the literal `0` is on the grid but paints
    /// nothing once it is 32768 px away — see `tile_texture`'s docs), and x must be the
    /// rect's own (a `0` there samples the tile at `rect.x() % tile_w` and slices the
    /// sprite horizontally at every decoration that does not begin on a tile boundary —
    /// the bug a fix for the y half alone introduces, and one that is visible in a
    /// screenshot).
    ///
    /// **Mutation check (all killed, singly):** `(0.0, 0.0)` fails the x assertion;
    /// `(rect.x(), rect.y())` fails the on-grid assertion; `(rect.x(), 0.0)` fails the
    /// proximity assertion. None is visible in `RenderNode`'s `Debug`, which prints only
