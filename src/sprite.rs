//! Sprite decoration: a theme naming an image to stand in for part of the closed
//! decoration vocabulary the engine already knows how to draw.
//!
//! **A sprite has two possible sources, and which one a reference resolves to is
//! decided by where its `themes.toml` came from** ([`SpriteOrigin`]). A file on disk
//! is read from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or an install directory) and is therefore
//! attacker-influenced input (`sdd/THEMING.md` § Untrusted input) — this module is
//! the one place such a path is turned into bytes, so every rule in [`resolve`]
//! exists to keep a hostile or careless theme file from reaching outside its own
//! directory or opening something enormous. A **built-in** theme's sprite, by
//! contrast, is compiled into the binary by [`BUILTIN_SPRITES`] and needs no file, no
//! install step and no validation: the bytes are this project's own, fixed at build
//! time.
//!
//! That second source is not an optimisation, it is the feature working at all. A
//! built-in theme is compiled in (`include_str!`) precisely so it renders on a fresh
//! install with nothing on disk, and a sprite it names has to keep that promise — a
//! reference resolved against a directory that only exists once someone runs an
//! installer is absent on every developer build, every `.app` bundle, and every host
//! whose packaging forgot the asset, silently, because an unresolved sprite is
//! indistinguishable from a theme that stated none.
//!
//! Three decoded forms are cached, all thread-local (GTK4 is single-threaded, so no
//! lock is needed and every unit test gets its own). **They live only while the
//! theme that named them is active:** [`clear_cache`] runs from [`crate::theme::set_active`],
//! so switching Pixel Quest → System drops every decoded raster rather than keeping
//! it for the rest of the process (TDD 18.58). The compiled-in PNG *bytes* stay in
//! the binary — that is the built-in-theme-with-nothing-on-disk promise, a few
//! kilobytes the OS can page out — and are not what this cache holds.
//! - [`texture`] — the sprite at its natural size, for a caller that scales it itself
//!   (the HTML export sink, which lets CSS do the scaling).
//! - [`scaled`] — the sprite pre-resampled to an exact pixel size with
//!   nearest-neighbour filtering. **Required** for anything drawn through GSK at this
//!   project's floor (`gtk4 0.10.3`, feature `v4_6`): `gtk_snapshot_append_texture`
//!   filters *linearly* with no filter choice — the nearest-neighbour variant,
//!   `append_scaled_texture`, is 4.10. Handing GSK an already-correctly-sized texture
//!   sidesteps the filter entirely, which is the only way pixel art stays crisp at
//!   any zoom on this floor (GTK4Rs skill; a `4.10`+ wrapper compiles and fails at
//!   link/runtime — GTK4Rs/AP-114).
//! - [`surface`] — the sprite as a cairo image surface, for the PDF sink.
//!
//! **Admission happens twice, and the second time is on an open handle.** [`resolve`]
//! decides whether a reference may be read at all, once, when the theme loads;
//! [`open_checked`] re-establishes what it can at each read, because everything
//! between those two moments is represented by a `PathBuf`. [`admit_for_decode`] adds
//! the bound `resolve` cannot express from metadata — the size of the *decoded*
//! raster — and is the single place a decode failure is diagnosed, so a sprite that
//! is absent because it could not be produced is distinguishable in the log from a
//! theme that named none (ScrAP-324).
