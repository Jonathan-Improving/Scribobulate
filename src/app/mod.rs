/// what it receives as file paths — so `scribobulate --help` against a running instance
/// asked that instance to open a document named `--help`, and the launching process exited
/// 0 having printed nothing. The reporter saw a switch silently do nothing; the primary saw
/// a file it could not open. Linux never showed it, because GIO parses options before it
/// forwards, so the two platforms disagreed about what an argument even IS.
///
/// So: if anything option-shaped is present, the caller must NOT forward and must let
/// GOption answer in this process — where `--help` prints help and an unknown option is
/// refused, identically on every platform.
///
/// The rules are POSIX's, not ours: a bare `--` ends option parsing (everything after it is

/// `scribobulate -- --help`.

/// about argv, not about a platform, and cfg-ing it would take its tests out of the build on
